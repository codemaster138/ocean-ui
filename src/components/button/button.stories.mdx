# Button

Like in every modern design system, the preffered component for CTAs is the button.

## Primary vs. Secondary Buttons

Buttons come in multiple flavors, namely _primary_ and _secondary_. There should _never_ be only a secondary button, and never more than one primary button (within a certain scope, like a card or the body).

So, if you have only one call to action, make it a primary button.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Primary"
    args={{
      primary: true,
      children: "Primary Button",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Primary" />

If you have multiple CTAs, make the most important one primary, and all others secondary. _The Primary button should always be the rightmost of all buttons in a row._

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Secondary"
    args={{
      primary: false,
      children: "Secondary Button",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Secondary" />

#### Both

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Both">
    <Button>Secondary</Button>
    <Button primary>Primary</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Icons in buttons

A button may optionally contain an icon. Unless this icon benefits from being placed on the right side (Like for example a rightwards arrow), the icon should be located on the left.

Why should the icon be on the left? Read this article: [“Where to place icons next to button labels”](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/where-to-place-icons-next-to-button-labels/) by Anthony on [uxmovement.com](https://uxmovement.com)

However, only use icons when they help the user understand what a button does.

### Note to developers

If a button contains an icon, put any text it contains into a `<span>`. This allows the icon to space itself correctly.

Also, It is possible that the following snippet shows an `MDXCreateElement` component. This is a but with storybook. Please replace it with a `span` tag when using OCEAN.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Icon Left" args={{
    primary: false,
    text: "Edit"
  }}>
    { (args) => <Button {...args}><UilEdit size="13"/><span>{ args.text }</span></Button> }
  </Story>
  <Story name="Icon Right" args={{
    primary: true,
    text: "Next"
  }}>
    { (args) => <Button {...args}><span>{ args.text }</span><UilArrowRight size="13"/></Button> }
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Icon Left" />
