# OCEAN
OCEAN is a design system for react.js, built with styled-components. It is clean and modern, and can be easily customized using styled-components. A website is in the works, but it'll probably take a while before it's ready.

The OCEAN design system is actively maintained, with new components coming out every month!

**`Note:`** OCEAN design is currently in BETA, so we can't guarantee the reliability of the system.
